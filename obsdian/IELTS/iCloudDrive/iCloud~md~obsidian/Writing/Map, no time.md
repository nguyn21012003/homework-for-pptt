The plans depict how the layout of a town named Hunderstone will change in the future compared to the present day. Overall it is clear that there will be radical changes in the layout of the town with the most noticeable being the removal of the air field, the addition of a industrial estate , the expansion of the transport system and the size reduction of the built-up area. 

At present, there arae the air field in the North west, which is linked to the A2 road, running from the North West to the roundabout in the West to South West and the railway which is set up from the North to the South. According to the proposed plans, while the roundabout and the A2 road will remain unchanged, the aird field will be converted to an industrial estate. At the same time, the railway is planned to be extended Northward and there will be a side road built to link the industrial estate with these two roads.

Meanwhile, in the East, the town center and the ring road will witness no change, whereas the build-up area, which currently surrounds them, will be narrowed down to its North. In the middle of the map, while the gas station will still stand there, another roundabout will be added on the railway and it will be linked to the A2 road and the  by two side roads. Along with the mentioned roads, the A4 road is expected to be built from the A2 road to the town center, while the main road will also be established from the ring road to an out-of-town area, all of which will facilitate the transport of the whole town.
